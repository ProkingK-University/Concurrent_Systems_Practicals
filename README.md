# 📚 Concurrent Systems Repository (COS 226) 🖥️

Welcome to the Concurrent Systems repository! 🎉
This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive resource for all the practicals related to the COS 226 module on Concurrent Systems.
Here, you will find a collection of practical exercises and projects aimed at understanding and working with concurrent programming and systems.

### 📝 What are Concurrent Systems?

Concurrent Systems, a vital field in computer science and software engineering, deals with the design, implementation, 
and analysis of systems that handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Such systems often involve parallel processing, distributed computing, and managing shared resources. 
Understanding and mastering concurrent systems is crucial for developing efficient and scalable software solutions.

This repository is dedicated to helping you explore the fascinating world of concurrent systems and gain hands-on experience in building robust and performant concurrent software.

### 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is thoughtfully organized into multiple directories, each corresponding to different practical exercises and projects covered throughout the COS 226 course. 
Within each folder, you will find detailed documentation, specifications, and code for the respective practicals. Y
ou are encouraged to dive into each project, experiment with the provided code, and explore various concurrent programming techniques.
